#
# Please conform to the following standardized commit message template.
#
# Structure your changelog into three parts separated by blank lines:
#
# ```
# <header>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>
# ```
#
# The <header> is composed of a <type> categorizing the commit,
# and a one-line <summary> for ease-of-access in logs:
#
# ```
# <type>: <summary>
# ```
#
# where <type> is restricted to one of:
#
# - feat     : a commit which adds new code.
# - fix      : a commit which corrects the behaviour of existing code.
# - refactor : a commit which modifies the implementation of existing code.
# - chore    : a commit which only modifies configuration files.
# - doc      : a commit which only modifies documentation.
# - test     : a commit which only modifies tests.
#
# and <summary> is such that the following conventions are followed:
#
# - The entire <header> is no more than 50 characters.
# - The entire <header> is lowercase ASCII.
# - The <summary> is written in imperative structure (this commit will...).
# - The <summary> does not contain any punctuation characters.
#
# The <body> is unstructured and provides creative freedom to elaborate in
# whatever way deemed necessary. There are only two guidelines:
#
# - No line is more than 72 characters.
# - Focus on *what* this commit does and *why* you did it, not *how*.
#
# The <footer> is for additional meta-data such as
#
# - Related issue tracking identifiers.
# - Co-Authors.
